Walk motion
===========

Objective
---------
Compute a walk motion for the biped robot.

Exercise 3
----------
Define trajectories for both feet and for the center of mass of the robot in
such a way that

* the robot performs at least two steps,
* when the robot is in single support, the center of mass is above the support
  foot,
* when the robot is in double contact, the center of mass is above the line
  segment linking the two foot centers.

We assume that the center of mass is at the origin of the trunc.
